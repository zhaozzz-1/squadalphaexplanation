            <h2 id="idXvkLKK">What is Corruption?</h2>
            <p id="ido5xljt">Corruption is a complex and pervasive issue that undermines the principles of fairness, transparency, and
                accountability in society. It involves the abuse of entrusted power for private gain, whether it occurs in
                government institutions, businesses, or other organizations. Corruption can take various forms, such as
                bribery, embezzlement, nepotism, and abuse of authority.</p>
            <p id="idcapRDe">Bribery, for example, is one of the most common forms of corruption. It occurs when an individual or entity
                offers, gives, receives, or solicits something of value in order to influence the action of an official in
                the discharge of their public or legal duties. Embezzlement involves the misappropriation of funds that have
                been entrusted to a person, often within a business or organizational setting.</p>
            <p id="idvdsdia">Corruption has far - reaching consequences. It erodes public trust in institutions, hinders economic
                development, and perpetuates social inequality. It diverts resources away from essential services such as
                healthcare, education, and infrastructure, and can lead to a breakdown of the rule of law.</p>

                accountability in our society.</p>
