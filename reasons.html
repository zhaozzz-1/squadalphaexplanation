        <h2>Reasons from the Perspective of the People</h2>
        <p>People are directly affected by corruption in their daily lives. When corruption exists in public services such as healthcare and education, it means that people may not receive the quality services they deserve. For example, bribes may be required to access medical treatment or get a place in a good school. This not only undermines the fairness of society but also affects the well - being of individuals and their families. Therefore, people have a strong motivation to understand and study corruption to protect their own rights and interests.</p>

        <h2>Reasons from the Perspective of Society</h2>
        <p>Corruption has a significant negative impact on society as a whole. It disrupts the normal operation of the market economy, as businesses may have to pay bribes to win contracts or gain advantages. This leads to inefficiencies and unfair competition, which in turn hinders economic development. Moreover, corruption erodes social trust and cohesion. When people perceive that the system is corrupt, they may lose faith in institutions and each other, which can lead to social unrest. Studying corruption is crucial for maintaining a healthy and stable society.</p>

        <h2>Reasons from the Perspective of the Government</h2>
        <p>For the government, corruption is a major threat to its legitimacy and governance. If corruption is widespread within the government, it can lead to a loss of public support and confidence. Additionally, corruption can undermine the effectiveness of government policies and programs, as resources may be misappropriated or misallocated. By studying corruption, the government can identify the root causes and develop effective anti - corruption strategies to improve governance and ensure the proper functioning of the state.</p>
